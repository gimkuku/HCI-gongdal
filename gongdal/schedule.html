      <h2>Manage your TIME, Win the CONTEST</h2>
      <p>
        Hello. We are team no.11. Christina, one of the today’s job seekers,
        prepares various contests to get a job. But for each content, she has
        difficulty managing due date because of different schedules and
        preparations. So, she is finding some a website that manages the
        schedule and organize portfolio. Finally, she found GONGDAL that manages
        the time of the contest and her portfolio after the contests! Our team,
        디자인은 누가하죠, is going to develop the GONGDAL that integrates of
        contests information, gives reviews of the specific contest to win,
        manages the documents and organizes schedule of the contest to fit
        Christina’s or other’s need. After managing time, users can win the
        contest!<br /><br />Here are the sketches we made by brainstorming. We
        picked those two because it is easy to manage time schedule with contest
        information. It is convenient to use and see the schedule visually
        because it is based on the calendar design. Users can share the time
        management schedule with teammates for scheduling. For the personal
        page, there are a clander shared by teammates. It shows the duration
        date of the contests. If you click the month, you can see the schedule
        of contest that you want to join. In this page, you can manage your
        schedule by week and the contests. Next, if you click see priority
        button, you can see the comparing board. In the comparing board page,
        people can set and see the expected time and get the priority.<br /><br />Next,
        if user clicks contest, users can see the contests information including
        Popular contests, recent contests and some information including
        preferences and view times. User can search the contests too. And if
        user click schedule page, user can manage their contests including
        number of contests, need time, priority and the schedule calendar
        related with the contests. If you go to the contest pages and click one
        of the contests, then people can see more detail by clicking the banner
        box. On this page, people can the contest at a glance. <br /><br />By
        the way, these two designs have pros and cons for each one. Firstly, the
        main page is good for watch contest list, shows start date and deadline
        of the contest on the calendar, and classifies contests by popularity or
        type. However, it is difficult to manage time schedule and cannot put
        another personal schedule. Secondly for calendar, users can easily
        manage schedule with expectation time and priority and share and edit
        the contest date and schedule with teammates. It is hard to see the
        contest information by type, though. In other words, it cannot classify
        by the type or popularity. <br /><br />firstly, for the simple task,
        user checks the schedule of the contest. On the main page, user can
        check the contest information including start and end date. Then if user
        click ‘schedule’, then she can see monthly and weekly schedule of the
        contest. Then, if user clicks specific month, then she can check weekly
        schedule calendar. If user click “contest” on the banner box, then they
        can check the priority in comparing board. Next, Participating in the
        contest is moderate task. On the main page, user can search for contest.
        User can check the contest info and chooses one that she wants to join.
        Then, user can put schedule of the contest on personal page. And then
        users can check all the contest lists that that she joins. Click the
        contest button on the banner and see the priority of contest. And then
        after participating in they contest and can manage the portfolio.
        Lastly, for the complex text, user can manage time and portfolio after
        participation. Click the “Schedule” button on the banner bar to manage
        time, schedule. On this page, user can edit contest list and each
        schedule. On the schedule table, there are the timeline and shows tasks
        with the text box. Click specific month to check weekly schedule with
        calendar. User can check number of contests and needed time. And click
        either of icons to see the sorted schedule. click “contest” button to
        see contest list and sorted by priority. Finally, user can manage
        portfolio and share information after the contest.<br /><br />
